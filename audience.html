		<h2> Audience Journey Mapping (Task 3) </h2>
		<h3>CORE READING: The Value of Customer Journey Maps: A UX Designer’s Personal Journey By Joel Flom  </h3>
<p>Customer journey maps are documents that visually illustrate an individual customer’s needs, the series of interactions that are necessary to fulfil those needs, and the resulting emotional states a customer experiences throughout the process. </p>
<h3> CASE STUDY </h3>
<p>Over the last 10 years, MyBoeingFleet has allowed customers to view detailed maintenance data and purchase replacement parts for their fleet of Boeing aircraft. This information-rich portal has become a trusted source of data and is integral to airlines’ operations. Although MyBoeingFleet was innovative for its time, Boeing began to realize that the ways in which it connected customers to information and supported specific individual workflows merited investigation. </p>
<h3> CREATING EFFECTIVE CUSTOMER JOURNEY MAPS  - APPLIED TO AUDIENCE CONSIDERATION </h3>
<ul>
  <li>Research based - on ethnographic research which serves as a contextualised inquiry that allows researchers to experience a day in the life of a customer. </li>

  <li>Behaviour based – assigning character traits to job roles – personas based on task functions like investigating or purchasing.  </li>
  
  <li>Identifying Pain Points - To fill the gap between their perceived notions and real customer experience, we chose to produce journey maps based on scenarios that revealed customers’ pain points, frustrations, and roadblocks that required our attention. This helped clearly illustrate some of the issues customers encountered and allowed stakeholders to shed their assumptions and begin looking toward a more optimal future state. </li>

  <li>Displayed effectively – using physical media can help to clearly display ideas and allow for interactions e.g. a poster board.  </li>

  <li>Adapting Service Design - rethink the role that digital channels play in influencing and living up to their commitment to service. </li>

	<h2>Content & Audience </h2>
	<p> Creating a mood board allowed me to distinguish pages my website needs to accommodate to the interests of the user:</p>

<p>A Main Page - what is digital fashion, description and introducing terminology </p>	
		<br>
		<p>What is Digital Fashion - how is it changing the fashion industry?, EXAMPLES: streaming fashion online, social media and influencer culture. </p>
		<br>
		<p>What is Digital Fashion - how is it changing the creative economy? blockchain clothing, digitised transactions, digital innovating to physical creation. </p>
		<br>
		<p>Sustainability Page - sustainable manufacturing processes, the longevity of fashion pieces, what is fast fashion? </p>
		<br>
		<p>Avatar Building game - applying iconic gaming skins to an avatar reveals information about pieces - (reference to gaming origins and normalisation of digital fashion through building characters digitally).</p>

<br>

<h3> Link Contrast checker</h3>
<p>"In both links and body text must have at least 4.5:1 contrast with the background (3:1 for large text) to meet WCAG 2 Level AA."</p>

<h3> Readability</h3>
<p>"Coleman Liau and ARI rely on counting characters, words and sentence. The other indices consider number of syllables and complex words (polysyllabics - with 3 or more syllables) too. Opinions vary on which type are the most accurate. It is more difficult to automate the counting of syllable as the English language does not comply to strict standards."</p>

<h3>Foreground & Background</h3>
<p>"WCAG 2.0 level AA requires a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for normal text and 3:1 for large text. WCAG 2.1 requires a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 for graphics and user interface components (such as form input borders). WCAG Level AAA requires a contrast ratio of at least 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text."

Large text is defined as 14 point (typically 18.66px) and bold or larger, or 18 point (typically 24px) or larger.</p>

<p> Ultimately, by testing Twinbru design criteria it is concluded to keep contrasting colours to provide formating and keep data concise and informative to allow for different skill set access. </p>

			<h2> Original Moodboard </h2>
			<p> Creating user profiles highlighted how to accommodate my audience by structuring my webpage like online fashion retailers, websites like ZARA, JADED London and ASOS and evaluating web features to avoid using the SHEIN website (see final moodboard for examples: menu> development> moodboard). Key ideas used for building to develop the final concept were brand identity and web features and function. </p>

<h1> Accessibility </h1>
<p>Accessibility is key componenet of any website as it determines the user capability to access information. To make information more accessible current folio pages exemplify a contrast of dark and light tones of text to highlight information.  Aspects such as alignment and inclusion of multimedia could be improved </p>
<p> The following subheading include site analysis by Webaim Contrast Checker and Readability test tool, for 'Twinbru.com' previously referenced in Audio. WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool was not able to run the animations of twinbru and exemplified dysfunction. </p>

<h3>Video Captioning</h3>
<p>As well as visual aesthetics to clarify information another way which accessibility can be implemented is through captioning. By captioning the final background video created on the video page this adds context to audio that may be unheard.</p>
