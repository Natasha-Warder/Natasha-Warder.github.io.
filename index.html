					<h1>In Vogue: Digital Fashion</h1>
										<p>The initial stages of the 2020 coronavirus lockdown in isolation meant that social media, gaming, Virtual (VR) and Artificial Reality (AR) use all increased. Therefore, presentation, consumption, and manufacturing of fashion had to change to meet new consumer demands. Today, Digital Fashion houses possess an effective business model digitising art and revolutionising e-commerce, which will integrate further, become mainstream and create environmental change. In Vogue: Digital Fashion will explore how digital fashion trends are making the wasteful fashion industry sustainable.</p>

										<img class="homegraphicc"  style="float:center" height="350px" src="homemedia/2runwayhome.jpg">
										<br>
										<p>The final site will be comprised of three parts. The first page will be how digital fashion has revolutionised the fashion industry. This will be focused on digitising clothing (preservation), product presentation and dissemination using social media, how digital fashion is relevant to social trends. The second page will be about why people like digital fashion, why it is growing in popularity and its gaming origins.  How digital fashion is impacting the creative economy, digital currencies and NFT collections and VR fashion (discussing creativity and relevance of sustainability behind digitised designer items). The third and most important page will be why the dissemination and use of digital fashion is essential to our environmental future. Comparing manufacturing stages of physical versus digital clothes, user conduct impacting sustainability and AR dressing rooms (highlighting features such as haptic feedback and what physical items are materially comprised of). </p>

					<h3>"I think that digital fashion's sustainable side not only exists but also has a huge potential that still needs to be fully exploited. In the past years, the garment industry has been highly condemned for its environmental, waste and pollution issues. Is digital fashion the solution we've been looking for?" </h3>
