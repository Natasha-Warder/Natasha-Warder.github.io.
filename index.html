In the past years, the garment industry has been highly condemned for its environmental, waste and pollution issues. Is digital fashion the solution we've been looking for?"</h3></div>

					<p> The initial stages of the 2020 coronavirus lockdown in isolation meant that social media, gaming, Virtual (VR) and Artificial Reality (AR) use all increased. Therefore, presentation, consumption, and manufacturing of fashion had to change to meet new consumer demands. Today, Digital Fashion houses possess an effective business model digitising art and revolutionising e-commerce, which will hopefully integrate further, become mainstream and create environmental change. In Vogue: Digital Fashion explores how digital fashion trends are making the wasteful fashion industry sustainable.</p>

				  <div class="homecardR2">
					<p>The first page ‘What is Digital Fashion’ explores the varying forms of digital fashion and why fast fashion production is unethical. To explore the digital fashion industry and economic benefits the second page ‘The Virtual Clothing Industry’ emphasises how digital fashion is impacting the creative economy as NFTs. The third page ‘Manufacturing Processes’ emphasises how digital fashion is essential to our environmental future to minimalise material waste and pollution.
