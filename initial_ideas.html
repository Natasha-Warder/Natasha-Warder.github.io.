	<p>The production and consumption of digital fashion is a progressive practice. Efficient methods of distribution and representation may answer why there has been a significant increase in applications and platforms which promote digital fashion following the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. Today, the popularity of digital fashion applications is still rising. The future of digital fashion sees turning traditional fashion industry practices digital, increased clothing sustainability, effective promotional methods and new, creative applications in games and virtual worlds. </p>
	<p> Digital Fashion is the creation, recreation, production, promotion and consumption of clothing built using computer technologies and 3D software.

<h2 id="section-4">Common Applications of Digital Fashion</h2>

<p> The most mainstream application of digital fashion is video game skins and clothing lines for gaming platforms. The popularity of digital clothing then transitioned to NFTS which mean you cannot easily copy or counterfeit creations and steal intellectual property (issue in fashion and art). A fashion NFT can be digital fashion, but digital fashion is not always an NFT. This is because digital fashion does not always need to be minted and stored on the blockchain. Digitally curated clothes can be used to disseminate digital brand promotion and boost advertising campaigns by being new and unique. This promotional method can also be applied to fashion shows which stream digital clothing onto physical models allowing for the perfect fit regardless of body type. </p>

<h2> Sustainable Applications of Digital Fashion</h2>
<p>Ecommerce has already seen a rise in fully virtual brands and virtual models online as there is more demand for sustainability by consumers (not wasting materials for promotion) and accessibility (covid case study). 
	Marketing digital clothing for increased user interactivity will establish more virtual clothing and influencers on social media. Not only does this exclude delivery and manufacturing emissions and waste it allows users to follow trends and rent out digital clothes for brief windows eradicating fast fashion trends.
