	<li>The fashion industry wastes about over 79 trillion litres of water every year producing clothes.</li>
	<li>To make a single cotton t-shirt, 2,700 litres of fresh water are required according to estimates, enough to meet one personâ€™s drinking needs for 2.5 years.</li>
	<li>Microplastics leach from landfills and water treatment plants into rivers, which then empty into oceans.</li>

<ul>
	<li>Up to 100 billion garments are produced by the fashion industry every year. And each year, as much as 92 million tons of clothing ends up in landfills.</li>
	<li>Some 15 million people live and work within sprawling municipal rubbish tips around the globe, combing through trash every day for items of the slightest value to sell for a pittance.</li>
	<li>As landfill sites are filled, some local species can be replaced by other animals that feed on refuse, like rats and crows. Leachate is the liquid produced in landfill sites. This can become toxic and thus contaminate nearby streams, ponds and lakes, damaging the habitat of many different organisms.</li>

<p> Digital fashion does not contribute to material waste and instead is preserved online. This is reflected using a spatial soundscape. </p>
<br>
<p> Digital fashion exists in games, cultural heritage archives, advertisements, and even personally curated content like our camera rolls. </p>
<br>
<p> The key to digital fashion sustainability is the final stage of its cycle does not require any form of disposal and only continues to exist and be repurposed and preserved for other platforms. </p>
