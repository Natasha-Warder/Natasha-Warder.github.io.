<p>Twinbru Homepage audio does not effectively provide an interface for visually impaired users, twinbru could improve this by introducing a read aloud button of their text to pair with the background music to increase accessibility. The effect of continual sound is pairs nicely with reading as users can subconsciously tune it out, no lyrics or distracting contrasts e.g. percussion, within the music choice. Contrastingly, as new information increases in quantity and animations transform from shapes into furniture products by scrolling down some users could also perceive the use of audio as cognitive overload, something to avoid. </p>
	
	<p>Overall, audio is useful for directing attention to important information, by pairing images with the audio, what the company is, what the product is, colours the products are available in, the company’s minimalist aesthetic. As non-speech audio may be readily identified by users Twinbru considers using synth music carefully to not distract from other media successfully. Yet, audio could provide more information on the company, have increased accessibility and the site could function similarly without it. </p>

<p> Texalab’s virtual experience shows the effectiveness of multiple media use, content highly related to each other. The standard of audio quality is difficult to produce, clear and prompts are concise. The company also has the potential to repurpose audio for external advertising. When engaging with the texalab site users must have appropriate hardware and software. In an open plan environment user experience could be effected negatively without headphones. </p>
<p> The site uses a prompt to indicate this, highlighting awareness of accessibility issues overall audio is useful for  reinforcing User Interface (UI) interactions. By pairing audio prompts of the seller with video, the human interaction becomes immersive effectively providing an interface for visually/audio impaired users and accommodates different learning strategies of users to meet alternative learning styles. </p>

	  <h1>Website Examples</h1>

	  <img src="audiomedia/twinbru.png" alt="twinbru" id="siteaudio" width="525" height="295">

	  <p>The Website Twinbru from Awwwards.com aims to advertise that “3D textures of our high-performance fabrics simplify your marketing process”. Audio is background music used as supportive tool to central text and shape animation (1). The purpose of Twinbru’s audio is to enhance textual information of which quantity increases by scrolling down (2). Twinbru uses background music which creates ambient noise. It allows users to focus on their product – digitised fabrics. There is also the option to mute the background noise which is effective as is recognises the variety of user preference (3). Although audio is effective in drawing attention to content it stops past the home page of the site creating a break in continuity which lacks cohesion.</p>

	  <p>The Website texa-lab by brand Jack Wolfskin from Awwwards.com use audio to create a more immersive exchange between the user and a virtual salesman (sound-effects and speech)  to advertise their completely recycled jacket from membrane production off cuts. The texpore-ecoskin jacket is simply a branch of their product variety (1), attempting to engage an existing consumer towards a more sustainable product. There is still a large focus on establishing the brand as a seller. Digitising a physical experience of retail relies heavily on audio like multichoice speech prompts indicated by the consumer which are verbally fed back by the seller (2). Like Twinbru there is an option for users to alter sound, mute or pause (3) – this less necessary for the site structure and makes information less clear as you are only able to experience visual cues from the speaker about the product. </p>

	  <h1>Evaluating & Editing Database Audio</h1>
<p>The use of BBC sound effect Moorland or Fast Flowing Stream will be used to highlight the waste of water during fast fashion clothing manufacturing processes on the third page of the site - sustainability.  The fashion industry wastes about over 79 trillion litres of water every year. To emphasise the importance of greener alternatives and the way digital fashion could significantly decrease waste, the sound of running water can be used to draw attention to this issue in an alternative medium not text heavy. </p>
<audio controls src="file:///Users/tashwarder/Desktop/MULTI%20A/mada_html_template/moorlandedit.ogg">

  </audio>
<p>As the focal point should be the sound of rushing water, using Audacity I edited this audio by cutting its end as the bird chirping climaxes. Moreover, by removing a bird section between first 18 seconds and mid-section the bird sounds remain at a consistent volume alongside the rush of water. By increasing gain +20.0 dB this highlighted the waters large and continuous flow. The Audacity file was exported to an .ogg file for ease of use, quality of sound and reduction in file size. In the final menu, sound quality is set quality to 5 and trim blank space before first clip was selected. </p>
<br>
<p>Similarly, the use of BBC sound effect Black Kite or Rubbish Tip will be used to highlight the accumulation of waste, it’s effect on human labour, living and creating sustainable environments. According to Roundup.org between 80 and 100 billion new clothing garments are produced globally every year. 87% of the materials and fibres used to make clothing will end up in either incinerators or landfills. Only 20% of discarded textiles are collected and only 1% of clothes will get recycled into new garments. To emphasise the quantity of clothing waste being produced annually the sound of swarming flies create an uneasy drone. This should effectively support visual media like images and infographics. </p>

  </audio>
<p>As the focal point should be the sound of swarming flies, using Audacity I edited this audio by cutting the start and end, keeping section 18 - 45 secs (the most movement of flies). By increasing Increased pitch by 17.439 percent this changed the key of the flies wings from F to G#/A♭. The Audacity file was exported to an .ogg file for ease of use, quality of sound and reduction in file size. In the final menu, sound quality is set to 7 and trim blank space before first clip was selected again. </p>
<br>
<p>Alternatively, the use of Free Music Archive sound effect Fluid dreams could be used for the main page or gaming skins dress up to help users focus on text heavy sections like popups on the main page or fashion pieces part of the game. This could assist a multimodal individual learning style which may help readers reinforce focus into the content especially these key pages of the site as initially impactful as both pages should primarily aim to increase user engagement. </p>

  </audio>
<p>As the focal point should be creating background noise using Audacity, I initially decreased pitch by -56.000 percent and subsequently multiplied speed by 0.440 which created a lower pitch and slower version of the original audio which is less distracting. This also increased the length of the audio substantially, although I cut the end of this audio in future I should consider cutting at a shorter duration and employing a loop feature. The Audacity file was exported to an .ogg file for ease of use, quality of sound and reduction in file size. In the final menu, sound quality is set to 4 and trim blank space before first clip was selected again. </p>
